Prompt 0:
Okay from scratch. I want to make a silo'd static site.
-A 50 state view (of the US, - Alaska - Hawaii, they're special, and we can include them out-of-frame in boxes later anyway
This front page, and in turn, 50 (or so) pages for each state of the USA.
This state page will display a 'Person', and 'Opinion' section.
The Person section is going to say their zodiac signs (rising sun, falling moon or something like that, make it 'more than 1 item set' sizing. And include a picture of them. Only first name. And a set of emoji reactions.
So it's a page-per-person and a 50-state ui dashboard (but as a map, all snazzy, please. You know what would look sick-as-shit and good ux to use)
As well, some more non-USState pages. FAQ/About, Membership, Contact Us.
FAQ give me a sample of 3 questions. Make them up, what WOULD someone ask about this. Don't worry I'll replace them. About part, we offer distinguished opinion services to a select clientelle. Other than this, time will tell.
Membership, will include its cost and requirements, as well as its benefits, so 3 sections to Membership. Requirements are going to be earnings/tax-return statement of 200k or more AGI. Please scrub your SS# please.

Contact us will be a P.O. Box Address and that is IT. Placeholder one in NY
